# 🏟Sports Management Application

A **mobile-first sports management platform** designed to simplify sports venue booking, team formation, and event participation in Nepal.  
This project addresses the inefficiencies of the current manual system, offering a localized and modern solution for both **players** and **venue managers**.

---

## Problem Statement
In Nepal, booking futsal courts, cricket grounds, or badminton halls is still manual — requiring calls, inquiries, and negotiations that often lead to:
- Miscommunication & double bookings  
- Lack of transparent pricing & scheduling  
- Difficulty forming complete teams  
- Limited visibility of local sports events  

Existing global solutions (like Playtomic, SportsKey) are not adapted to the Nepali context (e.g., no eSewa integration, limited community features).  
This project fills that gap by building a **localized and community-focused sports management app**.

- 🔍 **Venue Discovery & Booking** – Search, view, and book available time slots with real-time updates.  
- 👥 **Team Formation** – Connect with players to complete squads for futsal, cricket, etc.  
- 🎟️ **Event Registration & Ticketing** – Register for tournaments, buy tickets, and receive updates.  
- 📲 **Automated Notifications** – Booking confirmations via SMS/email.  
- 💳 **Secure Payments** – Integrated with **eSewa**, Nepal’s leading digital wallet.  
- 🏢 **Venue Manager Dashboard** – Manage reservations, schedules, and customer communication.
